# Introduction
## Purpose

Although this project has an academic focus, the chosen theme will help to understand the CRUD system (Create, Read, Update and Delete) and its requirements in a simpler way. In this document the role of the users and their interactions, requirements of the problem and its description will be detailed. A user interface will also be proposed and its limitations will be planed.

## Scope

"Electronics Store Management System " will be an application designed to be developed in Java with a database connection, where you can create, read, update and delete products from a store. It will have as data the name of the product, an ID and its price. Where the user will be able to consult said information

There are different users with different authority in the system, to which, not all users can access the data in the same way.

Although the project can be managed and designed to be commercialized, it will be more focused on an academic purpose.

# Overall Description
## Product Perspective

The system consists of an application for consultation and modification of data, therefore it is divided into two parts.
The application needs a constant communication with the database to retrieve the information in real time and thus show the current status of each product and be able to modify this state.


## Product functions

The main function of the system is to provide information to the user and the complete management of the system to the administrator. Thus making an application for the management of a electronics store.

## User characteristics

There are three types of users, the end user, the administrator and the owner of the electronics store. Each of them has different use cases and therefore each one has different characteristics in the requirements

The end user can only use the application to find stocks of the product. This means that the user can only interact with and search the search interface. It is important that the product that is searched matches the data.

The owner of the electronics store does not have to navigate in the application, its function will be to modify and update the products but will not have access to the change of ID unless it is a new product.

The administrator will have access to the data, being able to modify it and confirm that the information is valid.

## Constraints
The different interfaces that are needed can become a restriction due to the difficulty of adapting. Since it opens a difference of navigation depending on the type of user.

The hardware can be an impediment due to the high cost it can generate for a simple electronics store.

If you want the end user to search for the product, you need a more functional interface that is face-to-face / physical.

## External interface Requirements

Here you will see all the details about the inputs and outputs that have been planned for the system. There will also be a description of hardware, software and its communication between interfaces and a basic prototype of the user interface is also provided.
